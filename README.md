MLClassification is a repository for training your first Deep Neural Network (DNN). This easy to use setup uses Keras (TensorFlow) to train a DNN in Google Colabatory. I've included an iOS and Android app which can be used to run inference on your trained model.

This is all you will need to train the model and is also the starting point for this tutorial. The colab notebook uses Keras (TensorFlow) to train a Image Classification model.

# iOS
[![Build status](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/0637c714-cec7-48bb-8478-95b17cd97aa3/branches/main/badge?style=flat)](https://appcenter.ms/users/will.thieme/apps/mlclassification-ios/build/branches)
